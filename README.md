# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Glad to see you there. I'm a software engineer based in Yerevan, AM specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional websites, applications, and everything in between. 

**Little roadmap:**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning new stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything new, intersting and trendy.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about everything, but after Googling it. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@danomov](https://linkedin.com/in/danomov) or email me.
- âš¡ Fun fact: if something looks easy, itâ€™s hard; if it looks hard, itâ€™s almost impossible.
